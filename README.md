# 1010ml

WIP project made using the Processing framework for Java.

The vision was to make a machine learning model to play the mobile game "1010". The currently popular (Dec 2024) game "Block Blast" is a near replica of 1010.

As of this commit, only the gameplay loop (grid, piece placement, generation, and lose condition) have been implemented.

Run this project by downloading the code (as .zip), importing into a shared folder within the Processing IDE and running from the file "tenten.pde".
